# jl-btree
b-trees! This is currently under development and the makefile only produces a "test" target. It's a project mostly for my own educational benifit, and I (mostly) have not, and plan not to read any information about B-trees or their implementations beyond this [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree). As of this commit, my next goal is to develop a subtree-level locking scheme providing a safe framework for writing multithreaded b-tree operations.
